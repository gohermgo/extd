# extd

A set of extensions that I often use for the standard library, based on functions that I miss from OCaml.

They may often be entirely unecessary, I just find it pleasing to see my own functions appearing on types I never specifically implemented them for.
I also think they just make sense, even if they often may save one or two lines.
The point is not to play code-golf, it is to just provide some extensions to the standard library.
That means to me: functions, or patterns, that you may use often, provided through cohesive trait implementations (or any number ways).
